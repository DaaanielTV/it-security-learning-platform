Project: IT Security Learning Platform
Goal: A web app that offers interactive lessons on IT security topics such as network security, encryption, penetration testing, malware analysis, and more. The platform should include quizzes, virtual labs (VMs for exercises), and practical examples to enhance learning. It should also track user progress.

Core Features:
User Registration & Login:

Users can register, create an account, and save their progress.

User profiles store progress, completed lessons, test results, and badges.

Password recovery and account management features.

Learning Materials & Lessons:

Each lesson should consist of text, videos, practical examples, and interactive exercises.

Topics will include network security, encryption, penetration testing, malware analysis, etc.

Lessons are broken down into modules with progress bars to show completion.

Interactive labs: Virtual machines (e.g., using Docker or VirtualBox) where users can practice in a safe environment.

Quizzes & Progress Tracking:

Quizzes at the end of each lesson to assess users' knowledge.

Immediate results feedback and the ability for users to track their progress in their profiles.

Points, badges, or certificates for completing courses and milestones.

Interactive Labs (Virtual Machines):

Each lesson could include a practical lab for users to test what they've learned (e.g., penetration testing tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap, etc.).

Use platforms like Docker to create isolated, secure environments for exercises.

Option for users to save and compare their results.

Gamification & Reward System:

Users can earn badges and rewards for completing lessons, passing quizzes, and reaching certain milestones.

Leaderboards for users with the most points.

Admin Dashboard:

Admins can add new courses, topics, and lessons, and update existing content.

Manage user accounts, including tracking user progress and managing permissions.

Create and manage quizzes and practical exercises.

Manage badges and gamification elements.

Ability to add new interactive labs and configure virtual machines.

Database:

MySQL or MongoDB for storing user profiles, course content, progress data, and quiz results.

Each user has a personal profile to store progress on courses, earned badges, and quiz scores.

Admins can manage courses, lessons, and quizzes in the database.

Technologies:
Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Frameworks like React.js or Vue.js for building the user interface).

Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

Integration of Chart.js or similar libraries to display progress bars and charts.

Backend:

Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic and API.

MongoDB or MySQL for storing user data, course content, and progress.

Passport.js for user authentication.

Interactive Labs:

Use Docker or VirtualBox to create isolated virtual machines for penetration testing and other security exercises.

Integrate penetration testing tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap, etc., as interactive labs.

Gamification:

Use Firebase or a similar technology to implement a leaderboard and reward system with badges and points.

Extensions:
Penetration Testing API: Implement an API that allows users to safely test web applications. The API could use common penetration testing tools and enable users to apply specific tests on their own servers.

Social Learning: Allow users to connect with groups, participate in discussions, and collaborate on challenges.

Certificates & Awards: Issue official certificates upon completing courses or modules, which can be displayed in users' profiles.

Real-time Collaboration: Enable users to collaborate in a secure, shared environment to work on exercises (e.g., penetration testing as a team).

Admin Dashboard (Backend):
Dashboard:

Overview of active users and their progress.

Ability to add new courses and lessons with various content types (text, video, quiz).

Manage virtual machines and practical exercises (labs).

Ability to integrate external resources and tools for interactive lessons (e.g., Hack The Box).

Course Management:

Easy interface for creating new courses and lessons with various content types (text, video, quiz).

Manage interactive labs and virtual machines for security exercises.

Option to integrate external tools or APIs for real-world exercises.
